# Arc Tree Thingy

An expiremental ArcExplorer alternative written in pure Rust.

## Build

```
cargo build --release
```


-----------------
Changed some stuff:
You'll need to clone smash-arc and make some stuff in it public (no idea what exactly since I'm just using some data.arc code I had when testing dir info stuff)
